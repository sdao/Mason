Extract Ldraw parts files here.
The Mason project reads all Ldraw part files (including the basic bricks) out of this directory.
If there are no files here, then it won't be able to create any brick geometry in the scene.

E.g. go to <https://www.ldraw.org/parts/latest-parts.html> and download `complete.zip`.
Then extract its contents into this directory.
